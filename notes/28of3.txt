reusuable oop graph - directed label - use to store retweet graph
directed edge between users e.g. @dun retweets @hello, direction matters
how many times tweet (don't create duplicate links just add +1)

TwitterGraph class? start- behaviours - define vertex, edge between vertices, access that info

every label is a string.  method add(src,target) 
remove (src , target) - remove 1 / all?
getAllVertices()
getArcsFrom(src)
load/save graph from file? or break out functionality into GraphIO class taking instance of twitter graph allows you to save graph/ reload graph.

don't use serialisation

loop through graph - output to file

@hi [p, p ,p]
@h  [6,5, ,0]

Graph interface?

graph io - load graph(file name) / store graph(filename)

try to have low dependencies between code.

will eventually store other graphs

take 222222222222 <tab> @fauci RT: ,,,,,extract it get handle of original tweet, add connection into graph

submit retweet graph

could build graph in opposite direction (retweeted graph) , in twitter graph could build invert - has all same arcs but turned backwards
or add(dest,src) and put in another file

email  - who does what, when etc.

parsing tweet file when class isn't done - parse tweet fall ,instead of calling add just print to screen. (trace code to keep track of retweet count)
replace println with graph 

wednesday - see if commits are being made,
