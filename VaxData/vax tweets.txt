1507432922353074177	@sarahesteinberg	@NataliaHodgins yes. I'm fortunate that I was freelancing for 13 years before I got #longcovid / #cfsme so I can (sorta) choose how much I work. it's still difficult because it's so hard to give clients timelines now and I'm slower and stupider than I was, but it is good to do some work.	0	Fri Mar 25 19:03:10 GMT 2022
1507432929999339536	@LArtdelInfusion	So this was "the plan".  Everyone should catch COVID and then we'll all get over it because it may be "like a cold". Nothing from the government, DoH or @nb_docs about #longCOVID, nothing about the people who'll die from the disease.   A "bump" in the plan?!  This is disgusting!	0	Fri Mar 25 19:03:11 GMT 2022
