COMP30880 Software Engineering Project Sprint 2 by Conor Barry, Jane O'Brien and Tom Higgins
Team NAME: Tojaco

RUNNING FROM JAR

- java -jar tojaco.jar to use the bundled in config file.
- To use your own config file use java -jar tojaco.jar {pathtoconfigfile}

- If using a custom config file, note that a sample configuration file is given in config/default_config.txt. Use that file as a template for your config file
  and put in your API KEYS

The tasks were divided evenly between the team members. See commit history for a clearer idea of who carried out which tasks, but pair work was often carried out with just one person committing the finished result.

If running from source ensure to add the Twitter4J library to the classpath.
